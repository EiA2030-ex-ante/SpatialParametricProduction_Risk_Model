# SpatialParametricProduction_Risk_Model
This repository contains R code for estimating the Just-Pope production risk model and the Antle (1983) moments based production risk model. These are estimated using OLS, Lewbel (2012) identification strategy and spatially varying coefficient Bayesian models. The notebook presenting these methods is here: <a href="https://eia2030-ex-ante.github.io/SpatialParametricProduction_Risk_Model/" target="_blank"> JustPope and Moments Risk Models</a>
